        "- Start by having the serving player initiate the rally with a serve to the receiving player's backhand side.\n" +
        "- After the receive, the receiving player should respond with a controlled backhand shot. Focus on using proper footwork and racquet preparation.\n" +
        "- Aim to hit the ball cleanly with your backhand, directing it to different areas of the court with accuracy.\n" +
        "- Pay attention to your body positioning and weight transfer, ensuring balance and stability throughout the shot.\n" +
        "- The serving player should then attempt to return the backhand shot with a soft volley or an aggressive shot, depending on the situation.\n" +
        "- Continue rallying back and forth, alternating between serving and receiving, with both players focusing on executing quality backhand shots and maintaining a consistent rally."
